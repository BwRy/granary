Setting up a virtual machine (VM) for testing Granary
=====================================================

## Pre-requisites

  1. Make sure QEMU is installed.
  2. Make sure KVM is installed.
  3. Enable hardward virtualization.
  4. Download a Linux distribution disk image (.iso) file.

## Step 1: Create a VM image.

```basemake
qemu-img create -f qcow2 vm.img 20G
```

## Step 2: Install the distribution into the image

This will launch the VM and allow you to run through the OS's
installing process.

```basemake
$(which qemu-system-x86_64) -m 2048 -hda vm.img -cdrom <path-to-your-iso> -boot d
```

## Step 3: Create a convenient VM-launcher script

For example:
```basemake
#!/bin/bash

QEMU=$(which qemu-system-x86_64)

SMP=2
MEM=2048

# e1000 is a good choice if you want you want to debug a network driver
NETWORK=virtio 

$QEMU -cpu host -enable-kvm -smp $SMP -m $MEM -hda <path-to-vm.img> -net nic,model=$NETWORK -net "user,hostfwd=tcp::5556-:22" -gdb tcp::9999  &
```

## Step 4: Launch the VM and install SSH and SSH-Server

We need these so that Granary's `load.py` script can copy files
to and from the VM.

```basemake
sudo apt-get install ssh
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

## Step 5: Install your build of the kernel into the guest OS

For this step, we will need kernel image and header packages in the
Debian kernel package format. See [Building the Kernel](building-the-kernel.md)
for instructions on how to generate these files.

Copy the Debian kernel packages into your VM, and install them
in the way described in the aforementioned document.
