The following is a list of people who have contributed to Granary (in alphabetical order):

 * Akshay Kumar
 * Mehrad Khalesi
 * Olantuji Ruwase
 * Peter Goodman
 * Peter McCormick

Granary's original implementation (not contained in this source code repository) was primarily
written by Peter Goodman and Akshay Kumar. That implementation was based on DynamoRIO Kernel (DRK).
The main author or DRK was Peter Feiner.

Advisors of the Granary project include Angela Demke Brown and Ashvin Goel.

## DynamoRIO
Granary depends on the instruction encoder, decoder, intermediate representation, and various
instruction manipulation APIs of DynamoRIO. Please see [DynamoRIO's acknowledgements document](https://code.google.com/p/dynamorio/source/browse/trunk/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS)
for the authors of the DynamoRIO components of Granary.

## MurmurHash
Granary uses Austin Appleby's MurmurHash as a hashing routine.

## Itanium C++ ABI
Granary uses some of the code from [OSDev.org's Itanium C++ ABI implementation](http://wiki.osdev.org/C++).
