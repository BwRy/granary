///
/// Note: A key concern is that objects shouldn't spill across two granularity-
///       defined areas. E.g. if the granularity is 8, then each zone is 256
///       bytes wide. If an object spaces bytes [250, 260], then it will be
///       across two zones and resolve to the incorrect descriptor.
///
/// Note: One approach that deals with the above issues is duplicating a
///       descriptor entry across adjacent zones. This is possible because
///       partial indexes make the descriptor table (if used) more sparse.
